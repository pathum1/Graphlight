# TaskbarEqualizer

A lightweight Windows 11 taskbar graphic equalizer that provides real-time audio visualization in the system tray.

## Features

- ðŸŽµ Real-time audio visualization in Windows 11 taskbar
- âš¡ High-performance FFT analysis with <50ms latency
- ðŸŽ¨ Windows 11 Fluent Design compliance
- ðŸ”§ Configurable frequency bands (8-32 bands)
- ðŸ’¾ Lightweight footprint (<30MB RAM, <3% CPU)
- ðŸš€ Auto-start with Windows support

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: C# WPF (.NET 8)
- **Audio Processing**: NAudio with WASAPI loopback
- **FFT Analysis**: FftSharp
- **System Integration**: Win32 Shell_NotifyIcon API

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - This project is currently being built following a structured 4-phase approach.

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure
- [ ] WPF project setup with .NET 8
- [ ] NAudio integration for audio capture
- [ ] FftSharp integration for frequency analysis
- [ ] Basic system tray implementation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking framework

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Visualization engine (Weeks 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: User experience & polish (Weeks 5-6)
- **Phase 4**: Testing & deployment (Weeks 7-8)

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular architecture with separated concerns:

- **Audio Capture Service**: WASAPI loopback capture
- **FFT Analysis Engine**: Real-time frequency spectrum analysis
- **System Tray Visualizer**: Dynamic icon generation
- **Configuration Manager**: Settings and preferences
